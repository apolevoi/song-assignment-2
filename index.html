                    <p class="rxn">General Overview:</p>
                    Partita for Eight Voices is a uniquely innovative a cappella piece written by Caroline Shaw that explores the juxtaposition of speech and song. By definition, a “partita” is an instrumental suite made up of a series of variations. Therefore, it is likely that Shaw uses this term in her title to frame her work for the listener as an instrumental piece that consists of many individual moments, collectively forming a cohesive whole.  
                    <br><br>
                    After examining this piece, I chose to represent the first movement called Allemande visually in the picture above, demonstrating how Shaw layers different sounds on top of each other, creating new, and unexpected effects that compel the listener to pay close attention. The piece begins with repeated directional elements that are soon overcome by the organized chaos of sung musical chords that range from soft whispers to subtle hums. Shaw pushes the boundaries of the traditional musical realm throughout the course of the piece, implementing a rising melody and bright timbre.
                     <br><br>
                    In my visual representation, I have depicted the different sounds (such as “ahh” or “ooh) that Shaw uses with various symbols, and use color to represent the volume intensity. Here, dark blue stands for loud volume and light blue stands for soft to medium volume. With the help of this diagram, one can see how Shaw’s use of stacked harmonies incorporating spoken words simultaneously with sung notes creates an unexpected melody despite the piece’s innate dissonance. Her uniquely experimental style is evident by how many sounds she chooses to incorporate throughout the piece as portrayed by the many different symbols pictured above. 
                     <br><br>
                    However, the fact that Shaw organizes such chaos into precise patterns makes the piece feel incredibly compelling and premeditated. One can tell from the fact that she repeats several sounds multiple times throughout the piece that it still retains an underlying structure despite her fixation in the use of human speech. In many ways, it feels as though Shaw is calling upon her listeners to discover new meaning in the human voice and to appreciate its capacity to be seen as music. Rather than trying to extract a sole harmony or melody from this piece, especially since the harmony is constantly changing, it appears as though the most enjoyable way to listen to it is to take in each new noise as it is introduced and recognize how it sounds like chords and patterns heard in one’s past.

                     <p class ="rxn">Specific Analysis:</p>
                    In order to even better understand this piece, I chose to hone in on one particular section that is dominated by singing chords with the addition of some layered speech. In the visual depicted above, I used a slightly different system to represent this portion of the piece. Again, different symbols represent the different types of sounds that are being heard, but this time the volume intensity is represented by the size of the symbol. 
                     <br><br>
                    Particularly, this part of the song reminds me of “In paradisum,” one of the Gregorian chants we looked at earlier in the year, because during the moments of sung chords (for ex: 0:24-0:3Eight) all of the voices are in unison in a group setting. Additionally, there is no fixed rhythm or meter so it has a floating, spiritual quality similar to “In paradisum.” Both pieces are also unaccompanied, which serves as another similarity. Yet, despite their similarities, these two pieces are extremely different in effect because the singing portions of Partita for Eight Voices has no words and has a much more energetic timbre than “In paradisum” because of how the voices are constantly changing. 
                     <br><br>
                    On the other hand, the fact that this piece has recurring repetition of specific sounds, implements contrast and symmetry, and moves rapidly, also feels evocative of many of the other Baroque pieces we have studied such as Vivaldi’s Violin Concerto in B Major. Just like the Partita for Eight Voices contrasts speech and sung chords, Vivaldi contrasts the orchestra and soloist, while also creating rhythmic energy by playing quick oscillations that remind me of how the Partita quickly changes voices and different sounds. Despite these similarities, this piece by Shaw lacks the flashiness and virtuosity emblematic of this Baroque piece and many of the other ones we have looked at. 
                     <br><br>
                    Therefore, in short, this segment of Allemande jumps between a Gregorian chant and Baroque style while also introducing a modern, innovative speech-like style. The fact that Shaw chooses to incorporate layered speech with sung chords into her piece sounds new relative to the other pieces we have studied because of its emphasis on the sounds made by human speech rather than the sounds solely created by instruments. In doing so, she breaks down the boundaries of music and shows that even chaos can be carefully constructed. 
                     <br><br>
                    Partita for Eight Voices feels particularly innovative because it combines moments of plainchant-sounding chords, electronic monotone male vocals, and spoken word, among other styles. In this way, it feels like a collage of different eras while also combining smooth and jerky moments into a single piece. I find the offbeat speaking moments interesting because the instructions recited create visual symbols in your mind yet they feel as though they stand alone rather than creating an entire picture. I also find it particularly unique that Shaw uses whispers and hums in a much different way than one usually experiences them in everyday interactions. Although these sounds are typically associated with sleep and quiet, she introduces these sounds in a way that feels spiritual and alert. Often times, the melody ascends after these moments, which creates more anticipation then I would normally associate with them in day-to-day life. The last aspect of her piece that feels innovative to me is her use of restraint. In many moments of the sung chords, the volume escalates quickly to the point of shouting or screaming yet still feels controlled because of her expert sense of timing and overlapping of musical moments.

                    The first time I listened to this piece I struggled to enjoy it because of its unfamiliar style. Personally, I have not had a lot of exposure to a cappella music, which made me feel slightly unsettled while listening to the piece at first. Yet, as with many things in life, the more I gave it a chance, the more I developed a well-balanced perspective. With each subsequent time I listened to the piece, I have found myself increasingly captivated by its innovative nature. From this piece, I not only have developed a liking of a Capella music, but also have found myself drawn to pieces that demand the attention of the listener through means of organized chaos. I am particularly drawn to the moments reminiscent of Gregorian chants because the melody becomes calmer and the harmony more consonant than in the rest of the piece. I also enjoy the overlapping sections of sung chords and speech throughout the movement because they create new sounds that I have never heard before and give me a new appreciation for the power of speech.

                    <br><br>
                    Shaw brings new meaning to common human sounds like whispers and sighs in an entirely fresh new way and therefore calls upon her listeners to be more observant about how music exists even where you least expect to find it. In fact, her piece inspires me to want to find more meaning in the trivial things in life because there is so much hidden beauty waiting to be discovered if one takes the time to seek it out.
